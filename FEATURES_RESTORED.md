### 3. **Network Plot Generation**
- **Network Plot Button**: Added "üï∏Ô∏è Generate Network Plot" button
- **Word2Vec Integration**: Uses semantic embeddings for word positioning
- **Interactive Clustering**: User can specify number of clusters (2-10)
- **Advanced Visualization**:
  - Semantic positioning based on Word2Vec similarity
  - Edge weights based on co-occurrence in transcript
  - Color-coded clusters with legend
  - Node sizes based on word frequency
- **Fallback Support**: Multiple model loading options and error handling
- **Export Functionality**: Save plots as PNG files

### 4. **Enhanced LaTeX Support**
- **Improved LaTeX Formatting**: Better equation handling and document structure
- **Mathematical Symbol Support**: Proper LaTeX rendering of special characters
